The "amtoolbox-x.x.x.zip" file contains Matlab/Octave scripts and source codes (C++, C, Fortran) of the models.

In order to run most of the experiments, auxiliary data are required. The auxdata will be automatically downloaded on demand.

Some of the AMT functions require a large processing time. Depending on the machine and the model, it might take even days. Thus, some AMT functions provide caching of calculated results. When started in the default mode, the cached results will be automatically downloaded. 

Have much fun!
